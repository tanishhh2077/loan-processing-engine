+Add a new file called server.py that implements the gRPC service defined in lender.proto.
+It should implement only the DbToHdfs RPC for now. The method should:
+- connect to MySQL (database CS544, password abc)
+- perform a join between applications and loan_types
+- filter loans with amount between 30000 and 800000
+- write the resulting table to HDFS at /hdma-wi-2021.parquet using PyArrow
+- use 2x replication and 1MB block size
+- return a StatusString message confirming success

+In server.py, I want you to implement the BlockLocations gRPC call. You can see how the input and output data is defined in lender.proto. The input is a string representing some file path, and the output needs to a Python dictionary (which is a map in proto) that records the number of blocks being stored by each DataNode in HDFS. You need to interact with HDFS using web requests with requests module and using requests.get. To find block locations, use GETFILEBLOCKLOCATIONS. You also must set the CLASSPATH environment variable to $HADOOP_HOME/bin/hdfs to access HDFS correctly. Add error handling and descriptive error messages when there are unexpected responses from the WebHDFS API. Make sure that this program works when running docker exec -it p4-server-1 python3 /client.py BlockLocations -f /hdma-wi-2021.parquet

+I want you to make some adjustments. For error handling, I want you to use specific error messages from the WebHDFS API. I also want you to set the environment variable to $HADOOP_HOME/bin/hdfs and validate the JSON structure before calling data.get('BlockLocations', {}).get('block', [])
